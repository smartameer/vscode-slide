Slide game is a classic sliding tile puzzle game where the goal is to arrange the numbers in ascending order by sliding them into an empty space. The game consists of a 4x4 grid with tiles with numbers from 1 to 15, and one empty space. To solve the puzzle, you must strategically move the tiles by sliding them horizontally or vertically. The challenge lies in finding the correct sequence of moves to reach the desired arrangement. This addictive game tests your mental agility, logic, and problem-solving skills. It can be played on various game levels of difficulty. You can now play Slide on VSCODE.
